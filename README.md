# DotaReplayViewer

A web app version of the prototype [command line app](https://github.com/aiyuni/DotaReplayViewer-ConsoleVersion) 

Note:  This is currently a localhost project only as it requires Dota 2 to be installed on the 'server'. 

Currently there is no known way to convert Dota 2 replay files (.dem) to .mp4.

This is a C# and React solution to automatically parse Dota 2 matches to mp4 so players can watch their replays without needing to launch the game client. 

Requires Dota 2, [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), and [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to be installed on the user's computer.
